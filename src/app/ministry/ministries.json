In June 2015, Paul brought home 6 filters (designed & manufactured by Dallas Baptist Men of Faith) and tested them in Phu Yen region of Vietnam where water source is scarce and extremely polluted. The church in Phu Yen installed some of them in the well at the church and provided locals free water. This gem sparked many conversations about the love and salvation of Christ.",
